Python also has a built-in class called `collections.Counter` that could do this in one line, but it's important to understand the manual implementation first."

Then, we find the intersection of the two sets using the `.intersection()` method, which gives us a new set containing only the elements that appear in both sets.\n3. Finally, we return the length of this intersection set, which is the count of matching elements.\n\nThe alternative one-line solution uses the `&` operator, which is the set intersection operator in Python. Both approaches have the same result, but the one-line version is more concise.\n\nThis problem demonstrates the power of Python's set operations for comparing collections of items without having to use nested loops, which would be less efficient."

We calculate the sum of all numbers from 0 to n using the mathematical formula: n * (n + 1) / 2. This gives us the expected sum of the complete sequence.\n3.
